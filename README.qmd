An `R` package for doing inference with coefficient alpha and
standardized alpha. Many methods are supported, with special emphasis on
small samples and non-normality. ***Note:*** This package is under
active development along with a companion paper.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#library("alphaci")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width='750px', dpi=200)
```

## Installation

The package is not available on `CRAN` yet, so use the following command
from inside `R`:

```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JonasMoss/alphaci")
```

## Usage

Call the `library` function and load some data:

```{r prepare, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library("alphaci")
library("psychTools")
x <- bfi[, 1:5]
x[, 1] <- 7 - x[, 1] # Reverse-coded item.
head(x)
```

Then calculate an asymptotically distribution-free confidence interval
for $\alpha$,

```{r}
alphaci(x)
```

You can also calculate confidence intervals for standardized alpha

```{r}
#| cache: true
alphaci_std(x)
```

## Supported techniques

`alphaci` supports three basic asymptotic confidence interval
constructios. The asymptotically distribution-free interval of
@Maydeu-Olivares2007-zh, the pseudo-elliptical construction of
@Yuan2002-oy, and the normal method of @Van_Zyl2000-si.

| Method       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `adf`        | The asymptotic distribution free method [@Maydeu-Olivares2007-zh]. The method is asymptotically correct, but has poor small-sample performance.                                                                                                            |
| `elliptical` | The elliptical or pseudo-elliptical kurtosis correction [@Yuan2002-oy]. Uses the unbiased sample estimator of the common kurtosis [@Joanes1998-jo]. Has better small-sample performance than `adf` and `normal` if the kurtosis is large and $n$ is small. |
| `normal`     | Assumes normality of $X$ [@Van_Zyl2000-si]. This method is not recommended since it yields too short confidence intervals when the excess kurtosis of $X$ is larger than $0$.                                                                              |

In addition, you may transform the intervals using one of four
transforms:

1.  The [Fisher
    transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_transformation), or
    $\alpha\mapsto \operatorname{artanh}(\alpha)$. Famously used in
    inference for the correlation coefficient.
2.  The $\log$ transform, where $\alpha \mapsto \log(1-\alpha)$. This is
    an asymptotic pivot under the elliptical model with parallel items.
3.  The identity transform. The default option.
4.  The [$\arcsin$
    transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions).
    This transform might fail when $n$ is small, as negative values for
    $\hat{\alpha}$ is possible, but $\arcsin$ do not accept them,

The option `bootstrap` does studentized bootstrapping [@Efron1987-ov]
with `n_reps` repetitions. If `bootstrap = FALSE`, an ordinary normal
approximation will be used. The studentized bootstrap intervals are is a
second-order correct, so its confidence intervals will be better than
the normal approximation when $n$ is sufficiently large.

Finally, the option `parallel = TRUE` can be used, which is
suitable if covariance matrix $\operatorname{Cov}(X)$ is compound
symmetric. If the distribution is normal or (pseudo-)elliptic, it can be
used to simplify the expression for the asymptotic variance of alpha and
standardized alpha to
$$\sigma^{2}=\frac{2k(1+\kappa/3)}{k-1}(1-\alpha)^{2},$$ where $\kappa$
is the common kurtosis parameter.
