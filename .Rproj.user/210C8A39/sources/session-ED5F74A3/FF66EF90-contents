## Linear regression equation

The equation for a linear regression is
:::

::: {#thm-line}
## Line

The equation of any straight line, called a linear equation, can be written as:

$$
y = mx + b
$$
:::

::: proof
This is obvious.
:::

See @thm-line.

::: {#exr-mlm-to-lm}
Deduce the equations for linear regression (@prp-lm) from @thm-line.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Make a Numpy array with evenly spaced numbers.
import numpy as np
x = np.linspace(-1, 1, 10)
x
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Print out all available data sets in the seaborn library.
import seaborn as sns
from pprint import pp
pp(sns.get_dataset_names(), compact = True)
```

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: Load and print excecise data.
exercise = sns.load_dataset("exercise")
exercise.head()
```
