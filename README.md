An `R` package for doing inference with coefficient alpha and
standardized alpha. Many methods are supported, with special emphasis on
small samples and non-normality. ***Note:*** This package is under
active development along with a companion paper.

## Installation

The package is not available on `CRAN` yet, so use the following command
from inside `R`:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JonasMoss/alphaci")
```

## Usage

Call the `library` function and load some data:

``` r
library("alphaci")
library("psychTools")
x <- bfi[, 1:5]
x[, 1] <- 7 - x[, 1] # Reverse-coded item.
head(x)
#>       A1 A2 A3 A4 A5
#> 61617  5  4  3  4  4
#> 61618  5  4  5  2  5
#> 61620  2  4  5  4  4
#> 61621  3  4  6  5  5
#> 61622  5  3  3  4  5
#> 61623  1  6  5  6  5
```

Then calculate an asymptotically distribution-free confidence interval
for $\alpha$,

``` r
alphaci(x)
#> Call: alphaci(x = x)
#> 
#> 95% confidence interval (n = 2709).
#>     0.025     0.975 
#> 0.6828923 0.7246195 
#> 
#> Sample estimates.
#>     alpha        sd 
#> 0.7037559 0.5536964
```

You can also calculate confidence intervals for standardized alpha

``` r
alphaci_std(x)
#> Call: alphaci_std(x = x)
#> 
#> 95% confidence interval (n = 2709).
#>     0.025     0.975 
#> 0.6938373 0.7331658 
#> 
#> Sample estimates.
#>     alpha        sd 
#> 0.7135016 0.5218675
```

## Supported techniques

`alphaci` supports three basic asymptotic confidence interval
constructios. The asymptotically distribution-free interval of
@Maydeu-Olivares2007-zh, the pseudo-elliptical construction of
@Yuan2002-oy, and the normal method of @Van_Zyl2000-si.

| Method       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `adf`        | The asymptotic distribution free method \[@Maydeu-Olivares2007-zh\]. The method is asymptotically correct, but has poor small-sample performance.                                                                                                              |
| `elliptical` | The elliptical or pseudo-elliptical kurtosis correction \[@Yuan2002-oy\]. Uses the unbiased sample estimator of the common kurtosis \[@Joanes1998-jo\]. Has better small-sample performance than `adf` and `normal` if the kurtosis is large and $n$ is small. |
| `normal`     | Assumes normality of $X$ \[@Van_Zyl2000-si\]. This method is not recommended since it yields too short confidence intervals when the excess kurtosis of $X$ is larger than $0$.                                                                                |

In addition, you may transform the intervals using one of four
transforms:

1.  The [Fisher
    transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_transformation), or
    $\alpha\mapsto \operatorname{artanh}(\alpha)$. Famously used in
    inference for the correlation coefficient.
2.  The $\log$ transform, where $\alpha \mapsto \log(1-\alpha)$. This is
    an asymptotic pivot under the elliptical model with parallel items.
3.  The identity transform. The default option.
4.  The [$\arcsin$
    transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions).
    This transform might fail when $n$ is small, as negative values for
    $\hat{\alpha}$ is possible, but $\arcsin$ do not accept them,

The option `bootstrap` does studentized bootstrapping \[@Efron1987-ov\]
with `n_reps` repetitions. If `bootstrap = FALSE`, an ordinary normal
approximation will be used. The studentized bootstrap intervals are is a
second-order correct, so its confidence intervals will be better than
the normal approximation when $n$ is sufficiently large.

Finally, the option `parallel = TRUE` can be used, which is suitable if
covariance matrix $\operatorname{Cov}(X)$ is compound symmetric. If the
distribution is normal or (pseudo-)elliptic, it can be used to simplify
the expression for the asymptotic variance of alpha and standardized
alpha to $$\sigma^{2}=\frac{2k(1+\kappa/3)}{k-1}(1-\alpha)^{2},$$ where
$\kappa$ is the common kurtosis parameter.
