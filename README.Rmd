An `R` package for doing inference with coefficient alpha and standardized 
alpha. Many methods are supported, with special emphasis on small samples
and non-normality.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#library("alphaci")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width='750px', dpi=200)
```

## Installation
Use the following command from inside `R`:
```{r install, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JonasMoss/alphaci")
```

## Usage
Call the `library` function and calculate the confidence interval.

```{r prepare, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library("alphaci")
library("psychTools")
x <- bfi[, 1:5]
x[, 1] <- -x[, 1] # Reverse-coded item.
alphaci(x)
```
## Supported techniques

`alphaci` supports three basic asymptotic confidence interval constructios. The
asymptotically distribution-free interval of Maydeu-Olivares et al. (2007), the
pseudo-elliptical construction of Yuan and Bentler (2002) for both general
models and parallel models. In addition, you may transform the intervals using
e.g. the Fisher transform. The option `bootstrap` does studentized 
bootstrapping and is recommended if the sample size is small.
